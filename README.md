Challenge 4 Timed Quiz

deployed link: https://avadeisler.github.io/Timed-quiz-challenge/

For this challenge, I am to create a timed quiz.

This is the Acceptance criteria for this challenge:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question

THEN I am presented with another 
question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over

THEN I can save my initials and my score

I had started this project initially before it was due. After being away from it for so long, I was a little lost on what I had left to do so I pretty much started over. The thing I am having a hard time with is getting the highscores to show up in list form on the highscores page. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong there. Other than that, this project was relatively straight forward but time consuming. Trying to figure out the timer intitially gave me some issues.
